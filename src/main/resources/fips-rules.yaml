# This file defines rules for FIPS compliance checks in Java applications.
# It specifies the categories, class names, method names, and argument indices for FIPS-related
# methods that should be checked for compliance with FIPS standards.# The rules are used to identify and validate the use of cryptographic algorithms and providers
# that are compliant with FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards).
# The rules are structured to include the category of the cryptographic operation, the class name,
# the method name, and the indices of the arguments that should be checked for FIPS compliance
